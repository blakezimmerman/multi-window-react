# Multi-Window React Apps

This repo contains the code samples and slides from my tech talk on creating multi-window web apps using React.
To run the code samples, do the following:

- `cd` into the directory containing this file
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the dev server on `http://localhost:3000`

To switch between the different demos, just change which imported component is passed to `ReactDOM.render` in `src/index.tsx`.
